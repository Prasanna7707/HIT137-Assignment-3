Hello team, As discussed as per our previous conversation , I am now uploading our assignment 3.

We have made Language Translation App using Google's Gemini AI LLM Model. 
We have made it for 7 languages : ["English", "French", "Spanish", "German", "Chinese","Hindi", "Nepali"]

In second question we have made a spaceship 2D Scrolling game . 
The game has following features : 
1. Hero as spaceship
2. Enemy as Hens
3. Eggs thrown by hens as bombs
4. Apples as collectibles.
5. The game has restart, play again, lives , scores, level features as well. The level increases as you kill more number of hens.
